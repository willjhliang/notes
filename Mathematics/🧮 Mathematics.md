The following covers the mathematics background required for [[🤖 Machine Learning]] and [[🧠 Deep Learning]].

[[ℹ️ Information Theory]] and [[🪙 Probability Theory]] are two common methods for analyzing and optimizing models. Some basic linear algebra is also useful.
1. [[📌 Norms]] and [[📏 KL Divergence]] measure the distance between vectors and probability distributions respectively.
2. [[🍿 Kernels]] measure similarity (analogous to the inverse of distance) between two vectors.
3. [[📎 Singular Value Decomposition]] decomposes a matrix and is commonly used for dimensionality reduction or compression.
4. [[👞 Evidence Lower Bound]] provides a lower bound on intractable probability distributions.
