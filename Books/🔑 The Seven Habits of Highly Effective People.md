# Summary
1. Growth comes from shifting fundamental paradigms—our values and principles—through significant effort and reflection.
2. The Private Victory deals with the power to be proactive, visualize our future, and discipline our actions.
3. The Public Victory involves learning to act with a win-win mentality, emphatically understand others, and cooperate with synergy.

# Notes
To improve, we must change how we perceive the world. In one-shot situations, we may get by with tips from the Personality Ethic—strategies to improve our image—but ultimately, it comes down to the fundamental integral and strength of our character that leads to greatness; our paradigm is the foundation how our attitude and behavior.

All humans share a set of unyielding principles. Unlike values or practices, these are universal ideals that we all yearn to uphold. The process and growth principle is of special interest: it states that we must grow individual abilities slowly, starting by acknowledging its current level and being open to improvement. There is no simple shortcut or trick—self improvement demands paradigm shifts that'll take effort, time, and significant self-reflection.

The following seven habits are based on principles, explaining how we can shift our character itself to grow. Each require knowledge, skill, and desire and will evolve us from dependence to independence to interdependence. As we grow, we must also keep in mind the P/PC balance between production (golden egg) and production capability (magic goose); reaping the benefits of the former and taking care of the latter are both crucial to long-term success.

First, there's the Private Victory: embedding proactivity, responsibility, and discipline deep into ourselves. Then with self-mastery comes the Public Victory: building strong, beautiful relationships with others. The key to the latter is investing in the emotional bank account, a metaphorical measure of how goodwill deposits with another person. Our most import deposits include understanding the other person, giving little kindnesses, keeping commitments, clarifying expectations, showing integrity, and apologizing sincerely after mistakes. Problems, big or small, can also be opportunities to strengthen a bond.

## Be proactive
Social determinism asserts that we are shaped by our genetics, upbringing, and environment. However, our self-awareness gifts us one freedom that cannot be conditioned—between stimulus and response, our freedom to choose.

This freedom enables proactivity. It means we're responsible for our own lives, making our actions based off decisions rather than conditions, values rather than feelings. What matters is not what happened but how we respond to the cards we are dealt.

Another way we can view proactivity is as a dynamic between the our concerns and our influence. Rather than focusing on the former, we must target the latter (what we can *be*); our influence will inevitably increase as a result. This is especially hard when our concerns include past mistakes, but the antidote to regret is the acknowledge it, then learn from it.

## Begin with the end in mind
The end of our life is the most powerful frame of reference we can use to examine what we're doing today. *How would we like to be remembered? What would we like our close ones to say about us?* The answers to these questions are our supreme values and personal mission, and we must make sure that each day of our life contributes meaningfully to them in some way.

This principle also applies to smaller-scale ventures as well. We must always remember our destination to avoid getting lost in the busyness of life. By visualizing what we want our future self to be, we avoid empty victories and wasted sacrifices.

In the grand scheme, our personal mission grants us security, guidance, wisdom, and power. Our center of this creed is not a significant other, family, money, work, possessions, pleasure, friends, religion, or the self. Rather, it's simply the principles that we seek to uphold, the ones that make up our values and mission.

## Put first things first
By mastering proactivity and visualization, we can now shape our reality with our actions. Putting first things first is the discipline of doing things when we don't want to do it—we do it not because it's easy, but because we must.

The things we struggle to put first are important but not urgent tasks, called "Quadrant II."" We have to proactively work on Quadrant II and also say "no" to the unimportant ones. Often, it helps to schedule our goals, making sure to adapt them into our daily plans. However, as we plan our efficient days, we must also keep in mind that *people are more important than things*, and our plans will inevitably change. Our primary focus is on relationships, and the secondary is on time.

## Think win-win
Cooperation and the win-win ideology is a paradigm for successful relationships. The crux of our interactions must be the possibility of a third alternative where everyone benefits.

Win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, and win mentalities are all extremely common, and any can be appropriate in certain situations. However, in most cases, interdependence thrives through win-win. Even in situations when agreement isn't possible, agreeing to disagree—resulting in a "no deal"—is also okay; it's better to walk away amicably than to cause resentments from a loss on one side.

To achieve win-win, we must excel in five dimensions.
1. Character, the virtues of integrity, maturity, and the abundance mentality—the paradigm that there's enough for everyone.
2. Relationships and constant deposits into the emotional bank account.
3. Agreements, shifting the paradigm to partnership and self-supervision through mutual understanding.
4. Systems that reward win-win agreements instead of competition and dichotomies.
5. Processes that focus on the problem and not the person.

## Seek first to understand, then to be understood
We often rush into prescriptions without taking time to form a diagnosis. In interpersonal relations, the most important principle is to understand the other person first before we demand to be understood.

Empathic listening is a crucial skill that's often overlooked. Most listen with the intent to reply, not understand—this causes us to see the other's message through our own paradigms instead of their's. If we listen to understand, we satisfy the other person's need to be understood, and that will open up communication on all fronts.

At its core, empathic listening is just rephrasing content and reflecting feeling, but underlying the words is a balance between logical and emotional responses, slowly peeling away layers of understanding and identity. Gradually, we'll understand the other person's paradigms—things they've taken to be facts of life—and express our own ideas to a much more receptive audience.

## Synergize
Synergy makes the whole greater than a sum of its parts. Synergistic communication requires us to be open to changes; in doing so, we're free to consider new possibilities and alternatives. This principle can be applied anywhere from teaching to business as long as a high level of trust and cooperation exists.

The differences between people give new opportunities for creativity and growth. *Everyone sees the world not as it is but as they are.* Realizing this fundamental paradigm and recognizing the possibility of both people being right gives us rich new experiences and knowledge. This is the path to a third alternative.

## Sharpen the saw
Our final habit is renewal on four fronts: physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional. It's critical that we express all our dimensions regularly and consistently, making an investment in ourselves for our future.
1. Physically, we need to eat, rest, relax, and exercise. To improve, we need to exert ourselves beyond our limits so that nature can rebuild us stronger than before.
2. Spiritually, we must reflect and renew our value system, taking time to think about the core of our soul. Meditation and nature can help remove distractions and tie us back to this center.
3. Mentally, it's imperative to keep our minds sharp. We do this by continuously learning new things, honing our mind and preventing atrophy.
4. Emotionally and socially, we must not only maintain relationships but also build our own sense of security through integrity and peace of mind. This require personal harmony with our values and cooperative interdependence with others.

Self-improvement also involves others. We are influenced by how others perceive us, so we are responsible for what we reflect to others about themselves. As Goethe taught, "Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be."

Lastly, as we continue in the upwards spiral of growth, we must remember to educate and obey our conscience. This is the final key to the cycle of learning, commitment, and action that follows from the seven habits.
